/*
In Java, operators are special symbols that perform operations on variables and values. Java provides a rich set of operators to manipulate variables. Operators in Java can be classified into several categories:

Arithmetic Operators
Unary Operators
Relational Operators
Logical Operators
Bitwise Operators
Assignment Operators
Conditional (Ternary) Operator
Instanceof Operator
1. Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic operators are used to perform basic mathematical operations.

+ Addition: Adds two values.
- Subtraction: Subtracts one value from another.
* Multiplication: Multiplies two values.
/ Division: Divides one value by another.
% Modulus: Returns the remainder of a division operation.

public class operator {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
    
    int a = 10;
int b = 5;
System.out.println("a + b = " + (a + b)); // 15
System.out.println("a - b = " + (a - b)); // 5
System.out.println("a * b = " + (a * b)); // 50
System.out.println("a / b = " + (a / b)); // 2
System.out.println("a % b = " + (a % b)); // 0
