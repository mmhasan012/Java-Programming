/*
A Java program typically goes through five phases from development to execution. These phases are:

1.Edit
2.Compile
3.Load
4.Verify
5.Execute

1. Edit
In this phase, the programmer writes the source code in a text editor. The source code is written in a file with a .java extension. Various Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) like Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, and NetBeans or simple text editors like Notepad++ and VS Code can be used for this purpose.

2. Compile
During the compile phase, the Java compiler (javac) converts the source code (.java file) into bytecode (.class file). Bytecode is a platform-independent code that can be executed on any system that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

Example:
javac HelloWorld.java

This command generates a HelloWorld.class file containing the bytecode.

3. Load
In the load phase, the JVM's class loader loads the .class file into memory. The class loader is responsible for finding and loading the necessary classes for the execution of the program.

4. Verify
During the verification phase, the bytecode verifier checks the loaded bytecode to ensure that it is valid and does not violate Java's security constraints. This step ensures that the bytecode adheres to the Java language specifications and does not perform any illegal operations.

5. Execute
In the execution phase, the JVM's interpreter or Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler translates the bytecode into machine code, which is then executed by the host machine. The execution starts with the main method of the loaded class.

Example:
java HelloWorld

This command executes the HelloWorld class, starting with the main method.
